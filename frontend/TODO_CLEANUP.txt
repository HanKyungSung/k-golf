Remove legacy Next-style app/ directory when confident all components migrated to react-router.

Completed:
- Removed app/ directory & Next special files
- Repointed global styles to styles/globals.css
- Replaced all next/link & next/navigation usages
- Added new HomePage at src/pages/home.tsx

Pending:
- Remove unused dependencies (geist, next-themes if not needed)
- Decide on dark mode strategy without next-themes (or keep if working)
- Integrate backend API for bookings
- Implement PostgreSQL/Prisma

Verify:
- No imports from 'next/link' or 'next/navigation'
- No usage of useRouter
- All navigation uses react-router-dom Link/useNavigate
- App.tsx only imports from src/pages/*

Removed legacy Next.js app router files during migration to pure React Router:

- app/
- src/shims/next-link.tsx
- src/shims/next-navigation.ts
- src/pages/_app.tsx (if existed)
- src/pages/_document.tsx (if existed)
- src/pages/layout.tsx (legacy)
- src/pages/index.tsx (legacy re-export)

These files are staged for deletion (physically removed). This record kept for reference.

# POS Hub Execution Tasks (Incremental Checklist)

This file is the actionable slice of the broader plan in `pos/README.md`.
Mark items as you complete them. Keep commits small (1–2 checklist items each).

## Phase 0 – Scaffolding (Target: Minimal Push-Only Working Prototype)

### 0.1 Workspace & Dependencies
[x] Confirm `pos` is part of root workspaces (root package.json)  
[x] Run: `npm install` at repo root (installs electron deps)  
[x] Add / verify deps in `pos/apps/electron/package.json`: electron, better-sqlite3, uuid, axios, electron-log, keytar, typescript, ts-node  

### 0.2 Core Structure
[x] Create `src/core/` folder (db.ts, outbox.ts, sync.ts, auth.ts stubs)  
[x] Add `tsconfig.build.json` (output to `dist/`)  
[x] Verify `npm run dev:pos:electron` (or local script) launches Electron window  

### 0.3 Database Init
[x] Implement `initDb()` in db.ts: open `data/pos.sqlite`, enable WAL, create tables (meta, bookings, outbox)  
[x] Call `initDb()` early in `main.ts` before window creation  
[x] Acceptance: file `data/pos.sqlite` exists after startup (verified via dev run + verify:db script)

### 0.4 Enqueue (Local Create Only)
[x] Implement `enqueueBooking()` (inserts into bookings + outbox)  
[x] IPC handler `booking:create` → calls enqueue  
[x] Renderer temporary button triggers IPC  
[x] Acceptance: clicking button increases count in `outbox` table (verified via sqlite3)

### 0.5 Auth (Moved Earlier – Minimal Required for Protected Endpoints)
[ ] Implement `login(email,password)` → POST `/api/auth/login`; capture access & refresh tokens (if refresh provided)  
[ ] Store refresh token (keytar) & access token (memory)  
[ ] IPC: `auth:login`, `auth:getStatus`  
[ ] Preload: expose `login()` and auth status events  
[ ] Startup silent session check (`/api/auth/me`) sets authenticated state if valid  
[ ] Disable booking creation & sync buttons until authenticated  
[ ] Emit auth state changes to renderer  

### 0.6 Manual Push (Authenticated)
[x] Core `processSyncCycle()` implemented  
[x] Endpoint adjusted to `/api/bookings` with payload adapter  
[ ] Acceptance: After successful login, `forceSync` drains queue (booking dirty=0, outbox empty)  
[ ] Failure: 401 triggers auth-needed UI (no infinite retry loop)  

### 0.6a Room Hours Admin UI (Earlier Integration)
[x] Renderer Admin panel (temporary) lists rooms (id, name, openMinutes, closeMinutes, status)
[ ] IPC `rooms:list` → GET `/api/bookings/rooms`
[ ] IPC `rooms:update` → PATCH `/api/bookings/rooms/:id` { openMinutes?, closeMinutes?, status? }
[ ] Form with HH:MM inputs → convert to minutes, validate (close > open)
[ ] Status select (ACTIVE, MAINTENANCE, CLOSED)
[ ] After update, refetch availability using new stored hours (no openStart/openEnd params)
[ ] Guard visibility: only show if auth.role === ADMIN
[ ] Acceptance: Change hours → availability updates; set MAINTENANCE → availability empty; restore ACTIVE → slots return

### 0.7 Queue Size Indicator
[ ] IPC `getQueueSize` returns COUNT(*) from Outbox  
[ ] Renderer displays `Queue: <n>`; updates on enqueue & after sync  
[ ] Acceptance: enqueue increments immediately; push decrements without restart  

### 0.8 Online / Offline Probe
[ ] Interval (30s) GET `/health` sets `online` flag  
[ ] IPC `getStatus` returns `{ online, queueSize, auth }`  
[ ] Renderer status indicator reflects connectivity  

### 0.9 Scheduled Push Loop
[ ] Interval (15s) triggers `processSyncCycle()` if `online && auth==authenticated && queue>0 && !isSyncing`  
[ ] Acceptance: create offline, reconnect (and login if needed) -> queue auto drains  

### 0.10 last_sync_ts Meta (Pre-Pull)
[ ] After any successful push cycle sending >=1 mutation set `Meta.last_sync_ts` (ISO)  
[ ] Renderer shows `Last Sync: <time or –>`  
### 0.11 Backend Cleanup & Tests (Room Hours)
[ ] Run prisma generate; remove temporary `any` casts in booking route & seed script
[ ] Add tests: (a) booking outside hours rejected (b) MAINTENANCE availability empty (c) shrinking hours conflict returns 409

---
## Phase 1 – Introduce Pull (Requires Backend Endpoint)

### 1.1 Backend Endpoint
[ ] Implement `GET /api/booking/changed?since=ISO` returning array with `updatedAt` ISO

### 1.2 Pull Cycle
[ ] Extend `processSyncCycle()` to run pull after push  
[ ] Upsert returned rows; clear `dirty` if matched  
[ ] Update `last_sync_ts` **after** successful pull  

### 1.3 Snapshot Scope
[ ] (Optional) Limit stored bookings to future N days; delete older rows  

### 1.4 Status Aggregation
[ ] IPC `getStatus` adds `lastSync`, `failures` (push failures count)  
[ ] Renderer panel renders full status

---
## Phase 2 – Auth Hardening
[ ] On 401 during push/pull attempt refresh once then retry  
[ ] If refresh fails: emit `auth:expired` event → renderer shows login form  
[ ] Add logout (clear memory + delete keytar token)  

---
## Phase 3 – Orders / Products (Deferred)
[ ] New tables: products, orders, order_items  
[ ] Outbox types: `order:create`, `order:update-status`  
[ ] Backend incremental endpoints for products/orders changes  

---
## Phase 4 – Packaging
[ ] Add electron-builder devDependency & config  
[ ] Script `pack:win` (NSIS)  
[ ] Build artifact under `release/`  

---
## Minimal Implementation Order (Updated Fast Path)
1. 0.2 Core Structure  
2. 0.3 DB Init  
3. 0.4 Enqueue  
4. 0.5 Auth (minimal)  
5. 0.6 Manual Push Acceptance  
6. 0.7 Queue Indicator  
7. 0.8 Online Probe  
8. 0.9 Scheduled Push Loop  
9. 0.10 last_sync_ts  
10. Phase 1 Pull

## Acceptance Smoke Script
```
# Start offline
Create booking -> queue=1, dirty=1
Reconnect network
forceSync (or wait interval) -> queue=0, booking dirty=0
Login, restart app -> stays authenticated (refresh token)
```

---
## Troubleshooting Quick Reference
| Symptom | Check |
|---------|-------|
| DB file missing | Did initDb() run before window creation? Permissions? |
| better-sqlite3 load error | Node/Electron version mismatch; reinstall deps |
| Queue never drains | API endpoint URL / auth header / network status |
| Outbox duplicates | Ensure delete happens only after 2xx responses |
| Refresh token lost | Keytar store cleared (OS keychain) – login again |

---
## Deferred / Nice-To-Have Flags
- Backoff: exponential delay when attempt_count grows.
- Batch push: send multiple mutations in one request.
- WebSocket subscribe for live booking updates.
- Local overlap validation before enqueue.

### Auth / Security (Future Enhancements)
- Admin long-lived session TTL (ENV: ADMIN_SESSION_TTL_HOURS) — implement role-based cookie/session expiry (reverted for now).
- Rolling session refresh (extend on active use vs fixed expiry).
- Session revocation list / admin dashboard to force logout.

---

 - verify:db: (manual) check existence of `pos/apps/electron/data/pos.sqlite` after `npm run dev:pos:electron` start.
 - schema-migration: Replaced by clean slate PascalCase tables (Meta, Booking, Outbox). Use `POS_DB_RESET=1` env to forcibly recreate during dev.
 - auth-order: Auth moved earlier to test protected booking endpoint realistically.
(Keep this file pruned: remove completed sections or archive to CHANGELOG when stable.)
 - verify:db: (manual) check existence of `pos/apps/electron/data/pos.sqlite` after `npm run dev:pos:electron` start.

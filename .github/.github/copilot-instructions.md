# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## Documentation Guidelines

- **Do not create new markdown files** unless explicitly requested by the user
- When explaining concepts or flows, use **visual diagrams and code examples** in responses rather than creating documentation files
- Prefer inline explanations with ASCII diagrams, code snippets, and visual representations
- Only create documentation files when the user specifically asks for it
- Provide compact commit message when user ask for it

## Communication Style

- Use visual aids (diagrams, flowcharts, ASCII art) whenever possible to enhance understanding
- Show data flows and architecture using text-based diagrams
- Include code examples with inline comments for explanations
- Keep explanations concise and visual-first

## 📋 Project Specifications

### Business Requirements
- **Room Configuration:**
  - Room 4: Supports both left-hand and right-hand players
  - Rooms 1-3: Right-hand players only
- **Booking Duration & Menu:**
  - [x] Hours added as menu category (1-5 hours, $30-$150)
  - [x] Auto-add booking hours to seat 1 on new bookings
  - [x] Menu data migrated to SQLite for persistence
- **Late Arrival Promotion:** Customers arriving 20+ minutes late get 1 hour free
- **Score System:**
  - Admin can manually enter player scores
  - Track: Total hits, golf course name, final score
  - Standard: 18 holes, 72 hits baseline (par)
  - Scoring: Under 72 = negative score (e.g., -2)
- **Authentication:** Phone number only (login/register for both online and POS)
- **Billing:** Printing bill functionality required
- **Admin Dashboard:** Must be able to edit all bookings
- Need to fix the print
- **Need pulling (Sync up)**
- Way to handle transactions (billing)
  - saves into the db. Need schema and others.
- Maybe UI changes for current order page instead of vertical scroll we need tab but this can be handle later.
- Seat management:
  - [x] Seats decoupled from player count
  - [x] Max 10 seats with color coding
  - [x] Validation prevents orphaning items when reducing seats
- **menu pos** 
  - will need to have check list of what it was served or not.
- **Booking Availability & Time Slots:**
  - [x] **DECISION:** Unified time slot system (exact times for availability)
    - Walk-in bookings: Allow exact time selection (e.g., 1:12 PM)
    - Online booking availability: Based on actual end times (e.g., if walk-in ends 2:12 PM, next slot is 2:12 PM)
    - No rounding to standard intervals (:00, :30) - show real availability
  - [ ] Cleaning/buffer time: Decide if gaps needed between bookings (e.g., 15 min cleaning time)
  - [ ] Implementation: Backend availability endpoint should return exact available start times based on existing booking end times

### Open questions
- [x] ~~When the number of seats changes, does number of players also should changes?~~ → Decoupled: seats and players are independent
- [x] ~~How can we handle the "cached" data? for instance, menu added to the running booking etc in case of the restart the app.~~ → Menu now persists in SQLite, orders saved in localStorage

### Known Issues
- [ ] Print functionality needs refinement
- [ ] Split functionality needs fixing, when delete one of the splited item, it doesn't merge back (not sure if we want this) 
- [ ] Guest checkout: Should collect name and phone number
- [ ] when add menu, it doesn't update sqlite table.

## 🤔 Open Questions & Decisions

### 1. Guest Mode vs Auto-Registration

**Question:** Should we auto-register all walk-in customers or keep "Guest" mode?

**Current Behavior:**
- **3 customer modes:** Existing Customer, New Customer, Guest
- **Guest mode:** Creates booking without user account (`userId: null`)
- **New Customer mode:** Creates user account + booking

**Considerations:**
| Pro Auto-Register | Pro Keep Guest |
|-------------------|----------------|
| ✅ Builds customer database | ✅ Privacy protection |
| ✅ Enables loyalty programs | ✅ Data quality (avoid fake info) |
| ✅ Returning customer lookup | ✅ Clear distinction |
| ✅ Simpler UX (2 modes vs 3) | ✅ Customer choice |

**Options:**
1. Remove Guest → Auto-register all walk-ins
2. Keep Guest as-is (anonymous bookings)
3. Middle ground: Add "Convert to customer" post-booking

**Status:** ⏸️ Awaiting team decision

---

### 2. Denormalized Customer Data in Bookings

**Question:** Should we keep customer info (name/phone/email) denormalized in Booking table or normalize via userId reference?

**Current Implementation:**
```prisma
model Booking {
  userId        String?  // FK to User (nullable for guest bookings)
  customerName  String   // Denormalized for display
  customerPhone String   // Denormalized for contact
  customerEmail String?  // Denormalized (optional)
}
```

**Considerations:**

| Pro Denormalization (Current) | Pro Normalization (Join to User) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ✅ Guest bookings supported (`userId: null`) | ❌ Complex handling for guest bookings |
| ✅ Fast queries (no JOIN needed) | ❌ Slower queries (JOIN required) |
| ✅ Historical accuracy (snapshot at booking time) | ❌ Data changes affect past bookings |
| ✅ Customer data immutable after booking | ❌ User.name change → all bookings show new name |
| ✅ Simple API responses | ❌ Additional query complexity |
| ✅ Point-in-time records (audit trail) | ❌ Lost historical context |
| ✅ Works offline (POS use case) | ❌ Requires user data sync |
| ❌ Data duplication | ✅ Single source of truth |
| ❌ Update complexity if customer changes info | ✅ Updates propagate automatically |

**Business Context:**
- **Bookings are historical records** (like invoices/receipts)
- Customer info should reflect what was known **at booking time**
- Guest bookings (`userId: null`) need customer data without User account
- POS app needs offline-first design (denormalized = no JOIN, faster)

**Recommendation:** **Keep denormalized** for this domain because:
1. Bookings are immutable historical records (like financial transactions)
2. Guest bookings are a core feature (can't reference User if no account)
3. Performance-critical (admin dashboard lists 100+ bookings)
4. Offline-first POS requirements (minimize JOINs)

**Alternative:** If normalization needed, consider:
- Keep denormalized fields for guest bookings only (`userId IS NULL`)
- Add computed fields: `displayName` = `User.name ?? customerName`
- Hybrid approach with versioning/snapshots

**Status:** ⏸️ Open for discussion

## 👤 Backend & Admin Features - Phase 1

> **Goal:** Phone-based admin booking system

### Phase 1 Overview

**Feature Documentation:** `/docs/admin_manual_booking_feature.md`
**Schema Guide:** `/docs/database_schema_explanation.md`
**Phone Handling:** `/docs/phone_number_country_code_handling.md`

**Key Changes:**
- Phone becomes primary identifier (unique, required)
- Email becomes optional (nullable)
- Guest bookings supported (nullable userId)
- Track registration source (ONLINE/WALK_IN/PHONE)
- Admin audit trail (createdBy, registeredBy)

### 1.0 POS API Key Security Improvement – ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Status:** Must be addressed before production deployment

**Current Issue:**
- POS authentication uses hardcoded static API key: `'pos-dev-key-change-in-production'`
- API key is visible in frontend code (anyone with app access can extract it)
- Same API key for all POS devices (no device-specific authentication)
- API key never expires (no rotation mechanism)

**Required Changes:**

[ ] **Backend:**
  - [ ] Add `POS_ADMIN_KEY` to backend/.env.example with security warning
  - [ ] Change default value in requireAuth.ts from hardcoded string to env-only
  - [ ] Set unique, strong `POS_ADMIN_KEY` in production .env
  - [ ] Document API key security in backend README
  - [ ] Restart backend server after env change

[ ] **Production Deployment:**
  - [ ] Generate cryptographically secure API key (e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32`)
  - [ ] Update production backend .env with new key
  - [ ] Test POS connectivity with new key
  - [ ] Document key rotation procedure

[ ] **Future Enhancements (Phase 2):**
  - [ ] Per-device API keys (track individual POS devices)
  - [ ] Key expiration and rotation mechanism
  - [ ] OAuth2 device flow for proper authentication
  - [ ] Store device keys in secure location (not in frontend code)
  - [ ] Audit log for API key usage

**Security Context:**
- Current method: Header `x-pos-admin-key` bypasses session authentication
- Risk: Anyone with app access can extract key and impersonate admin
- Web app uses HttpOnly session cookies (secure)
- POS uses static API key (insecure for production)

**Documentation:**
- Authentication architecture: `/docs/admin_manual_booking_feature.md`
- CSP configuration: `pos/apps/electron/src/renderer/index.html`
- Middleware: `backend/src/middleware/requireAuth.ts`

[x] Deployed fix (commit d81e5c3: "fix: properly handle empty string for REACT_APP_API_BASE")
[x] Verified login works in production at k-golf.inviteyou.ca

**Implementation:**
- Environment Strategy: Empty string for production → relative URLs (`/api/auth/login`)
- Fallback for Development: `http://localhost:8080` when env var not set
- Webpack Logic: `process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE !== undefined ? process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE : 'http://localhost:8080'`
- Result: No CORS issues, same-origin requests in production

**Architecture:**
- Unified deployment: Single Node.js container serving both frontend static files and API
- Path structure: `backend/dist/src/server.js` serves `backend/dist/public/` (frontend build output)

## 🧹 Code Cleanup & Technical Debt

### UI Component Unification

**Button Components:**
- ✅ DashboardPage: All buttons unified (2025-10-20)
- ✅ BookingDetailPage: Using unified Button
- ✅ MenuManagementPage: Back button unified
- [ ] MenuManagementPage: Convert remaining raw `<button>` elements
- [ ] AdminPage: Audit and convert raw buttons
- [ ] BookingModal: Check button consistency
- [ ] Other components: Global audit for raw `<button>` usage

**Tabs Components:**
- [ ] DashboardPage has local Tabs implementation (TabsContext, etc.)
- [ ] primitives.tsx has different Tabs implementation
- [ ] Consolidate into single reusable Tabs component

**Design Tokens:**
- [ ] Extract common colors (amber-500, slate-700, etc.) into constants
- [ ] Define standard spacing and sizing scales
- [ ] Create typography variants
- [ ] Consider CSS variables or Tailwind theme extension

**Component Documentation:**
- [ ] Document Button component props and variants
- [ ] Add usage examples for all UI primitives
- [ ] Create Storybook or component gallery (optional)

## 🧪 Testing & Quality Assurance

### E2E Testing Setup – ✅ Partially Complete

**Completed:**
[x] Playwright E2E testing framework installed
[x] Test structure at `pos/tests/`
[x] Database helper with reset/seed functions
[x] Comprehensive booking creation test
[x] Test fixtures (customers.json, bookings.json)
[x] Automated test database setup script
[x] Documentation in `pos/tests/E2E_TESTING_GUIDE.md`
[x] Fixed Button component to forward data-testid prop

**Test Status: 3/5 Passing ✅**

**Passing Tests:**
- ✅ Should create walk-in booking with existing customer
- ✅ Should create walk-in booking as guest
- ✅ Should handle validation errors

**Failing Tests (Functional Issues):**

1. **"should create walk-in booking with new customer"**
   - Issue: Modal doesn't close after successful booking
   - Error: Modal still visible after "Create Booking" click
   - Root Cause: Backend API/onSuccess callback not triggering modal close
   - Location: `pos/tests/e2e/booking/create-booking.spec.ts:85`
   - Next Steps: Investigate BookingModal handleSubmit success flow

2. **"should disable guest mode for phone bookings"**
   - Issue: Continue button remains enabled for guest + phone booking
   - Error: Button enabled when should be disabled
   - Root Cause: React state update timing or validation logic
   - Location: `pos/tests/e2e/booking/create-booking.spec.ts:150`
   - Implementation: canProceedFromCustomerMode() validation exists but not working
   - Next Steps: Debug button disabled logic on customerMode step

### Pending Test Tasks

**Setup:**
- [ ] Set up test database: `cd backend && npm run db:setup-test`
- [ ] Install Playwright: `cd pos && npm install && npx playwright install`
- [ ] Configure test environment: Copy .env.example to .env.test
- [ ] Update TEST_DATABASE_URL in .env.test
- [ ] Add remaining data-testid attributes to components
- [ ] Restart backend server with updated middleware

**Test Execution:**
- [ ] Fix modal close issue in booking creation
- [ ] Fix guest mode validation for phone bookings
- [ ] Test all three customer modes (existing/new/guest)
- [ ] Verify authentication with API key
- [ ] Verify no foreign key constraint errors
- [ ] Run full E2E suite: `npm run test:e2e:ui`

## ✅ Completed Tasks Archive

<details>
<summary>Frontend Build & Deployment (Phase 1.8) - 2025-11-08</summary>

**Production API URL Fix (2025-11-06):**
[x] Fixed frontend API calls to use relative URLs instead of localhost
[x] Updated backend Dockerfile to set `REACT_APP_API_BASE=` (empty string)
[x] Fixed webpack DefinePlugin to handle empty string correctly
[x] Changed from `|| 'http://localhost:8080'` to explicit undefined check
[x] Deployed fix (commit d81e5c3: "fix: properly handle empty string for REACT_APP_API_BASE")
[x] Verified login works in production at k-golf.inviteyou.ca

**Build Path Simplification (2025-11-08):**
[x] Refactored frontend build output path for consistency across dev/prod
[x] Frontend now builds to `frontend/dist` then copies to `backend/public`
[x] Backend dev mode (`tsx watch`) serves from `backend/public`
[x] Backend production build copies `backend/public` → `backend/dist/public`
[x] Simplified webpack config: always outputs to `dist` (no conditional paths)
[x] Simplified server.ts: always uses `../public` relative to `__dirname`
[x] Added `backend/public` to .gitignore (build artifact)
[x] Commit eadde42: "refactor: simplify frontend build output path"

**Architecture Consolidation:**
[x] Unified deployment: Single Node.js container serving both frontend and API
[x] TypeScript structure: `rootDir: "."` compiles to `dist/src/server.js`
[x] Path resolution works in all environments:
  - Dev: `src/../public` = `backend/public`
  - Prod: `dist/src/../public` = `backend/dist/public`
  - Docker: `/app/dist/src/../public` = `/app/dist/public`
[x] Docker multi-stage build: frontend → backend → runner
[x] Environment strategy: Empty string for production (relative URLs), localhost fallback for dev

**Deployment Pipeline:**
[x] GitHub Actions: Build image → Push to GHCR → SSH to server → Pull & restart
[x] Server: DigitalOcean droplet 147.182.215.135, Nginx reverse proxy on port 8082
[x] Docker Compose: Automated migrations and seeding
[x] Database: PostgreSQL 16, all tables healthy, admin user seeded

  - [x] Issue: Email times were 4 hours ahead (e.g., 2:30 PM instead of 10:30 AM)

- **Component:** Web POS Booking Detail (`frontend/src/pages/pos/booking-detail.tsx`)
- **Issue:**
  - Actions panel shows no buttons for active bookings
  - Checking `booking.status === 'confirmed'` but API returns `'booked'`
  - Field mismatch: code checks `status` which has presentStatus values ('booked'/'completed'/'canceled')
  - Should check `booking.bookingStatus` for raw values ('CONFIRMED'/'COMPLETED'/'CANCELLED')
- **Root Cause:**
  - Backend `presentBooking()` returns both fields:
    - `status`: computed display value ('booked'|'completed'|'canceled')
    - `bookingStatus`: raw database value ('CONFIRMED'|'COMPLETED'|'CANCELLED')
  - Web UI checks wrong field with wrong values
- **Fix Applied:** (2025-11-25)
  - Changed all 3 conditions to use `booking.bookingStatus` instead of `booking.status`
  - Updated to uppercase values: 'CONFIRMED', 'CANCELLED', 'COMPLETED'
  - Fixed lines 843, 857, 862 in booking-detail.tsx
  - Commit: b821720 + follow-up fix commit
- **Impact:** Staff can now complete, cancel, and restore bookings from detail page
- **Testing:** Verify buttons appear and function correctly on production

**2. Web POS - Room Status Cards Showing Incorrect Bookings** ✅ FIXED
- **Status:** � RESOLVED (2025-11-25)
- **Reported:** 2025-11-23
- **Component:** Web POS Dashboard (`frontend/src/pages/pos/dashboard.tsx`)
- **Issues Fixed:**
  1. **Timezone Bug:** Used `toISOString()` which converted dates to UTC
     - Booking at 11:30pm PST Nov 24 showed as Nov 25 in UTC
     - "Today" comparison failed due to UTC/local mismatch
     - **Fix:** Use local timezone methods (`getFullYear()`, `getMonth()`, `getDate()`)
  2. **Pagination Bug:** API only returned first 10 bookings by default
     - Bookings beyond page 1 weren't loaded
     - **Fix:** Implemented separate API calls with date range filters
- **Solution Implemented:**
  - **Room Status:** Loads only today's bookings (0:00-23:59 local time)
  - **Timeline:** Loads current week's bookings (Monday-Sunday)
  - Dual API calls merged and deduplicated by booking ID
  - Backend added `startDate`/`endDate` query parameters
- **Performance Benefits:**
  - Reduced data transfer (today + week vs all bookings)
  - Typical load: 10-50 bookings instead of 100+ or 1000+
  - Independent refresh strategies for room status and timeline
- **Testing Completed:**
  - [x] Room cards show correct bookings for today
  - [x] Status colors accurate (green=empty, yellow=occupied)
  - [x] Empty rooms display "No booking"
  - [x] Bookings update on 5-second poll
  - [x] Works across all 4 rooms
- **Commits:** 
  - Timezone fix & pagination optimization (commit 5cf4243, 2025-11-25)
  - Reference: Timeline timezone fix (commit 43bbac8, 2025-11-20)

**2. POS Dashboard - Timeline and Room Status Refresh Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Status:** 🟢 RESOLVED (2025-11-20)
- **Issues Fixed:**
  1. **Timezone bugs in date handling:**
     - Fixed `BookingContext`: Extract booking date using local timezone methods instead of `toISOString()`
     - Fixed `DashboardPage`: Compare dates using local timezone strings
     - Fixed `dateKey()`: Return local date string instead of UTC
     - Fixed `isBookingActive()`: Create Date objects using local timezone constructor
  2. **Timeline not showing bookings on initial load:**
     - Root cause: Two competing fetches (Timeline week fetch + Today fetch) overwriting each other
     - Solution: Removed duplicate Today fetch, Timeline week fetch now covers both
     - Today's bookings now filtered from week data instead of separate fetch
  3. **Timeline component not re-rendering:**
     - Added dynamic key prop to TimelineView component: `key={timeline-${length}-${firstId}}`
     - Improved day keys to include booking count: `key={dayKey}-${bookingCount}`
- **Result:** Bookings now display correctly in room status cards and timeline after restart
- **Commits:** Multiple fixes culminating in commit 43bbac8

- **Impact:** Medium - affects booking efficiency and user experience
- **Implementation Notes:**
  - Backend: Calculate available slots from existing booking end times
  - Add configurable buffer time (5-15 minutes for cleanup)
  - Frontend: Display suggested time slots dynamically
- **Related:** Booking Availability & Time Slots (Project Specifications)
- **Next Steps:**
  - [ ] Create backend endpoint: GET /api/bookings/available-slots?roomId=X&date=Y
  - [ ] Add buffer time configuration to settings
  - [ ] Update frontend booking form with time slot suggestions
  - [ ] Add validation to prevent overlapping bookings

**6. User Lookup Feature (Missing)**
- **Status:** 🔴 Open
- **Component:** Admin Dashboard / Customer Management
- **Requirement:** Ability to search and view customer details
- **Current State:** Basic phone lookup exists in POS, needs enhancement
- **Features Needed:**
  - [ ] Search by phone, email, or name
  - [ ] Display customer booking history
  - [ ] Show total spent and last visit
  - [ ] Quick access to create booking for customer
  - [ ] Edit customer details
- **Impact:** Medium - affects customer service efficiency
- **Related:** Phase 1.3 (User Lookup API exists but limited UI)
- **Next Steps:**
  - [ ] Design user lookup UI (search bar + results list)
  - [ ] Add to admin dashboard as new tab/page
  - [ ] Integrate with existing GET /api/users/lookup endpoint
  - [ ] Add customer detail modal/page

### Priority: MEDIUM

**5. Web POS Input Styling Issue**
- **Status:** 🟡 Known Issue (Non-Critical)
- **Component:** Web POS Booking Modal (`frontend/src/pages/pos/booking-modal.tsx`)
- **Issue:** Input fields (customer name, email, duration, players) missing padding despite explicit className
- **Current State:**
  - Added explicit `h-9 px-3 py-2` classes to all Input components
  - Styling fix not working in browser (functionality unaffected)
  - Users can still enter data and create bookings successfully
- **Technical Details:**
  - Base Input component has `px-3 py-1` in shadcn/ui
  - Custom classes added: `h-9 px-3 py-2 bg-slate-900/50 border-slate-600 text-white focus:ring-2 focus:ring-amber-500/50 focus:border-amber-500`
  - Potential Tailwind CSS specificity or merging issue
- **Next Steps:**
  - [ ] Investigate Tailwind className merging behavior
  - [ ] Try using cn() utility to properly merge classes
  - [ ] Check if custom bg color overrides padding
  - [ ] Consider using inline styles as workaround
  - [ ] Test with different Tailwind JIT compilation settings
- **Impact:** LOW - Cosmetic only, does not affect functionality
- **Priority:** Low - Can be fixed in future maintenance release

**6. Print Functionality Issues**
- **Status:** 🟡 Needs Refinement
- **Component:** POS Booking Detail (`pos/apps/electron/src/renderer/pages/BookingDetailPage.tsx`)
- **Issues:**
  - Print formatting needs improvement
  - Receipt layout inconsistent
  - Print preview not always accurate
- **Next Steps:**
  - [ ] Review CSS print styles
  - [ ] Test across different printers
  - [ ] Add print settings configuration

**6. Split Functionality Bug**
- **Status:** 🟡 Open
- **Component:** POS Booking Detail (Seat Management)
- **Symptom:** When deleting one split item, it doesn't merge back
- **Question:** Is this intended behavior or bug?
- **Next Steps:**
  - [ ] Clarify expected behavior with stakeholders
  - [ ] Document current split/merge logic
  - [ ] Implement merge-back if needed

**7. Booking Status Update Buttons Not Persisting**
- **Status:** 🟡 Open
- **Component:** POS Admin Dashboard (`pos/apps/electron/src/renderer/app/BookingContext.tsx`)
- **Symptom:** Reset/Complete/Cancel buttons only update UI, changes don't persist
- **Current Behavior:**
  - Buttons update React state (optimistic update)
  - Changes revert after page refresh
  - No database update or sync to backend
- **Root Cause:** `updateBookingStatus` only calls `setBookings()`, doesn't call IPC handler
- **Expected Behavior:**
  - Update local SQLite database
  - Mark booking as dirty for sync
  - Enqueue sync operation to backend
  - Persist across app restarts
- **Fix Required:** Make `updateBookingStatus` call `window.kgolf.updateBookingStatus()` like `updateRoomStatus` does
- **Impact:** Medium - booking status changes are lost, confusing for staff
- **Next Steps:**
  - [ ] Update `BookingContext.updateBookingStatus` to call IPC handler
  - [ ] Add optimistic update with rollback on error
  - [ ] Test status changes persist after refresh
  - [ ] Verify sync to backend works

**8. Menu Item Addition Not Updating SQLite**
- **Status:** 🟡 Open
- **Component:** POS Menu Management
- **Symptom:** Adding menu items doesn't persist to SQLite table
- **Impact:** Menu changes lost on app restart
- **Next Steps:**
  - [ ] Verify IPC handler for menu:create is called
  - [ ] Check SQLite write permissions
  - [ ] Add error logging for menu operations

### Priority: LOW

**8. Guest Checkout Data Collection**
- **Status:** 🟢 Enhancement
- **Component:** POS Booking Modal
- **Requirement:** Collect name and phone number for guest checkouts
- **Current State:** Guest bookings supported but minimal data collection
- **Next Steps:**
  - [ ] Add required fields validation for guest mode
  - [ ] Update guest booking flow with data collection form

## 📋 Project Specifications

### Business Requirements

**Overall Goal:** Simplify POS to focus only on essential operations (reference: NARU POS has many unused features)

**Core Operations:**
- **Centralized Booking Management:** All booking sources (Online/Phone/Walk-in) in one view
- **Room-Based Workflow:** Complete order-to-payment per room
  - View room status
  - Take orders per room/seat
  - Issue bills (per seat or combined)
  - Mark payment received (card/cash/tip)
  - Close out transactions
- **Monthly Sales Reporting:** Card sales / Cash sales / Tips

**Room Status Workflow (inspired by NARU POS):**
- 🟢 Green: Empty/Available
- 🟡 Yellow: Booked/Orders entered
- 🔴 Red: Bill issued (awaiting payment)
- 🟢 Green: Payment received & closed out

**Room Configuration:**
- Room 4: Supports both left-hand and right-hand players
- Rooms 1-3: Right-hand players only

**Booking Duration & Menu:**
- [x] Hours added as menu category (1-5 hours, $30-$150)
- [x] Auto-add booking hours to seat 1 on new bookings
- [x] Menu data migrated to SQLite for persistence

**Seat Management:**
- [x] Seats decoupled from player count
- [x] Max 10 seats with color coding
- [x] Validation prevents orphaning items when reducing seats

**Late Arrival Promotion:** Customers arriving 20+ minutes late get 1 hour free

**Score System:**
- Admin can manually enter player scores
- Track: Total hits, golf course name, final score
- Standard: 18 holes, 72 hits baseline (par)
- Scoring: Under 72 = negative score (e.g., -2)

**Authentication:** Phone number only (login/register for both online and POS)

**Billing:** 
- [x] Printing bill functionality (seat-specific)
- [ ] Payment tracking (card/cash/tip)
- [ ] Database schema for payment data

**Menu POS:**
- Will need checklist of what was served or not

**Booking Availability & Time Slots:**
- [x] **DECISION:** Unified time slot system (exact times for availability)
  - Walk-in bookings: Allow exact time selection (e.g., 1:12 PM)
  - Online booking availability: Based on actual end times (e.g., if walk-in ends 2:12 PM, next slot is 2:12 PM)
  - No rounding to standard intervals (:00, :30) - show real availability
- [ ] Cleaning/buffer time: Decide if gaps needed between bookings (e.g., 15 min cleaning time)
- [ ] Implementation: Backend availability endpoint should return exact available start times based on existing booking end times

### POS Dashboard Restructuring (Client Requirements)

**Current Layout:** Bookings / Timeline / Room / Menu / Tax
**New Layout:** Timeline / Room / Menu / Tax (remove Bookings section)

**Rationale:** Move booking functionality into Room section for unified workflow

**Timeline Section (Overview Only):**
- [x] Display one week of bookings for all rooms ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Grid view: Days (columns) × Rooms (rows) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Different color per room for easy identification ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Read-only, no interactions needed ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Real-time updates when bookings change

**Room Section (Primary Workspace - move Bookings functionality here):**
- [x] Display all rooms with current status color ✅ COMPLETED (Room Status Overview cards)
- [x] Click room to view/manage booking details ✅ COMPLETED (Manage/Book buttons)
- [x] Room Data Display with today's bookings ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Add orders per seat within room
- [ ] Issue bill (per seat or combined)
- [ ] Mark payment received (card/cash/tip)
- [ ] Close out transaction (returns room to available)
- [ ] Real-time status updates across all POS terminals

**Room Data Display:**
- [x] Booking time and duration ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Customer name ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Number of players/seats ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Current status (empty/ordered/billed) ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] Current orders by seat
- [ ] Bill status
- [ ] Payment status

**Implementation Priorities:**
- **Phase 1:** Dashboard restructure (remove Bookings, expand Room section) ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] Changed tab structure from 5 to 4 tabs (Timeline/Room/Menu/Tax)
  - [x] Added Room Status Overview section with color-coded cards
  - [x] Implemented status legend (green=empty, yellow=ordered, red=billed)
  - [x] Enhanced Room Management tab with detailed room info
- **Phase 2:** Room workflow with status color coding ✅ PARTIALLY COMPLETED
  - [x] Color-coded room status borders and indicators
  - [x] Room status dropdown in Room Management tab
  - [ ] Backend integration for status persistence
- **Phase 3:** Payment tracking (card/cash/tip) 🟡 MEDIUM
- **Phase 4:** Monthly sales report ✅ COMPLETED
  - [x] Added Monthly Sales Report to Tax tab
  - [x] Month navigation controls
  - [x] Card/Cash/Tips breakdown display
  - [x] Daily breakdown for 31 days (scrollable)
  - [ ] Connect to real transaction data

**Database Changes Needed:**
- Add `roomStatus` enum: 'available' | 'ordered' | 'billed' | 'paid'
- Add `paymentMethod` field: 'card' | 'cash' | null
- Add `tipAmount` field: number
- Add `paidAt` timestamp
- Add `closedBy` user reference

### Open questions
- [x] ~~When the number of seats changes, does number of players also should changes?~~ → Decoupled: seats and players are independent
- [x] ~~How can we handle the "cached" data? for instance, menu added to the running booking etc in case of the restart the app.~~ → Menu now persists in SQLite, orders saved in localStorage

---

## 🤔 Open Questions & Decisions

### 1. Guest Mode vs Auto-Registration

**Question:** Should we auto-register all walk-in customers or keep "Guest" mode?

**Current Behavior:**
- **3 customer modes:** Existing Customer, New Customer, Guest
- **Guest mode:** Creates booking without user account (`userId: null`)
- **New Customer mode:** Creates user account + booking

**Considerations:**
| Pro Auto-Register | Pro Keep Guest |
|-------------------|----------------|
| ✅ Builds customer database | ✅ Privacy protection |
| ✅ Enables loyalty programs | ✅ Data quality (avoid fake info) |
| ✅ Returning customer lookup | ✅ Clear distinction |
| ✅ Simpler UX (2 modes vs 3) | ✅ Customer choice |

**Options:**
1. Remove Guest → Auto-register all walk-ins
2. Keep Guest as-is (anonymous bookings)
3. Middle ground: Add "Convert to customer" post-booking

**Status:** ⏸️ Awaiting team decision

---

### 2. Denormalized Customer Data in Bookings

**Question:** Should we keep customer info (name/phone/email) denormalized in Booking table or normalize via userId reference?

**Current Implementation:**
```prisma
model Booking {
  userId        String?  // FK to User (nullable for guest bookings)
  customerName  String   // Denormalized for display
  customerPhone String   // Denormalized for contact
  customerEmail String?  // Denormalized (optional)
}
```

**Considerations:**

| Pro Denormalization (Current) | Pro Normalization (Join to User) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ✅ Guest bookings supported (`userId: null`) | ❌ Complex handling for guest bookings |
| ✅ Fast queries (no JOIN needed) | ❌ Slower queries (JOIN required) |
| ✅ Historical accuracy (snapshot at booking time) | ❌ Data changes affect past bookings |
| ✅ Customer data immutable after booking | ❌ User.name change → all bookings show new name |
| ✅ Simple API responses | ❌ Additional query complexity |
| ✅ Point-in-time records (audit trail) | ❌ Lost historical context |
| ✅ Works offline (POS use case) | ❌ Requires user data sync |
| ❌ Data duplication | ✅ Single source of truth |
| ❌ Update complexity if customer changes info | ✅ Updates propagate automatically |

**Business Context:**
- **Bookings are historical records** (like invoices/receipts)
- Customer info should reflect what was known **at booking time**
- Guest bookings (`userId: null`) need customer data without User account
- POS app needs offline-first design (denormalized = no JOIN, faster)

**Recommendation:** **Keep denormalized** for this domain because:
1. Bookings are immutable historical records (like financial transactions)
2. Guest bookings are a core feature (can't reference User if no account)
3. Performance-critical (admin dashboard lists 100+ bookings)
4. Offline-first POS requirements (minimize JOINs)

**Alternative:** If normalization needed, consider:
- Keep denormalized fields for guest bookings only (`userId IS NULL`)
- Add computed fields: `displayName` = `User.name ?? customerName`
- Hybrid approach with versioning/snapshots

**Status:** ⏸️ Open for discussion

[x] Added enqueuePullIfNotExists() for duplicate prevention
[x] Renamed IPC handler: debug:outbox:list → debug:syncQueue:list
[x] Updated comments to reflect bidirectional sync (push + pull)
[x] Verified build and fresh database creation

**Rationale:** "SyncQueue" better represents bidirectional operations (push/pull) vs "Outbox" (unidirectional)

### 0.9.3 Menu Backend Integration & Sync – ✅ Completed

[x] Removed 30-day booking cleanup logic (retain all historical data)
[x] Removed default date filter from bookings:list IPC handler
[x] Added sync event listener to BookingContext for auto-refresh
[x] UI auto-updates within 2 seconds when sync completes

**Implementation:**
- Full sync: Fetches all bookings on fresh install/login
- Incremental sync: Only fetches changed bookings since last sync
- Auto-refresh: Dashboard updates automatically when new bookings arrive
- Data retention: All historical bookings preserved (no automatic cleanup)
- Pagination: Client-side pagination shows 10 bookings per page with navigation

### 0.9.5 Sync Interval Optimization – ✅ Completed

[x] Configure electron-builder in package.json (appId, productName, targets)
[x] Add build scripts: pack, dist, dist:mac, dist:win, dist:linux
[x] Create app icons (512x512 PNG for macOS/Linux, 256x256 for Windows) - Skipped (using default)
[x] Test local build (`npm run build && npm run dist`)
[x] Verify executable in `release/` directory
[x] Fix database path to use app.getPath('userData') instead of process.cwd()
[x] Include .env file in packaged app for production API URL
[x] Fix .env loading to check process.resourcesPath for packaged apps
[x] Test installation and login with production API

**Phase 2: GitHub Release Automation** ✅ COMPLETE
[x] Created `.github/workflows/pos-release.yml` workflow
[x] Configured matrix build (macos-latest ARM64, windows-latest x64)
[x] Added steps: checkout, setup Node.js, install deps, build TS
[x] Fixed Electron native modules issue (better-sqlite3, keytar)
  [x] Created cross-platform rebuild script (scripts/rebuild-native.js)
  [x] Auto-detects architecture with os.arch()
  [x] Rebuilds with Electron headers (--target=35.7.5)
  [x] Works on macOS, Windows, Linux
[x] Upload artifacts (DMG, EXE installer)
[x] Added GitHub Release creation step (on tag `pos-v*`)
[x] Tested workflow with manual trigger (workflow_dispatch)
[x] **Verified:** macOS ARM64 artifact tested and working ✅
[x] **Verified:** Windows x64 build working in CI ✅

**Phase 3: Public Release Distribution** ✅ COMPLETE
[x] Created UI-triggered workflow with version input
[x] Added pre-release flag option
[x] Configured automatic release to public repository (k-golf-release)
[x] Set up GitHub Personal Access Token (PUBLIC_RELEASE_TOKEN)
[x] Created automated release notes with installation instructions
[x] Fixed platform-specific verification steps (bash vs PowerShell)
[x] Successfully published first release (v0.1.0) ✅
[x] **Public releases available at:** https://github.com/HanKyungSung/k-golf-release/releases
[x] Created comprehensive release documentation
[x] Added customizable release notes template (RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md)

**Phase 4: Auto-Update System** ✅ COMPLETE
[x] Installed electron-updater dependency
[x] Implemented auto-update in main.ts:
  - Initial check after 10 seconds on app launch
  - Periodic checks every 12 hours
  - Auto-download updates in background
  - Auto-install on app quit (silent updates)
  - Event listeners for all update states
  - IPC handlers for manual check and install
[x] Updated workflow to generate update metadata:
  - Removed `--publish never` flag
  - Added GH_TOKEN for electron-builder
  - Generates latest-mac.yml and latest.yml
  - Generates .blockmap files for delta updates
[x] Created comprehensive documentation:
  - Auto-update guide with testing procedures
  - Updated release guide with auto-update section
  - Complete explanation of pipeline changes
  - Troubleshooting and best practices
[x] Added version display in POS app header (2025-11-22):
  - Version badge next to clock using VERSION.txt
  - Automatic version copying during build process
  - Text loader configuration for esbuild
  - Proper .gitignore for generated files

**Documentation:**
- Release Process: `/docs/pos_release_guide.md`
- Auto-Update Guide: `/docs/electron_auto_update_guide.md`
- Native Module Fix: `/docs/electron_native_module_fix.md`
- Version Tracking: `/pos/VERSION.txt`
- Release Notes Template: `/pos/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md`

**Native Module Fix (Critical):**
- **Problem:** better-sqlite3 v11 uses prebuild-install which downloads prebuilt binaries for system Node.js (MODULE_VERSION 131) instead of Electron's Node.js (MODULE_VERSION 133)
- **Solution:** Created `pos/apps/electron/scripts/rebuild-native.js` to rebuild native modules with correct Electron version
- **Implementation:** Uses node-gyp with --target=35.7.5 --arch=[auto-detected] --dist-url=https://electronjs.org/headers
- **Result:** Both local and CI builds now work correctly with proper native modules

**Resolved Issues:**
[x] **FIXED: Electron renderer not showing on macOS ARM64 CI builds** (2025-11-12)
  - **Root Cause:** NODE_MODULE_VERSION mismatch (131 vs 133)
  - **Solution:** Cross-platform rebuild script with automatic architecture detection

**Active Issues:** See [Active Issues & Bugs](#active-issues--bugs) section at top of document

**Phase 5: Code Signing** ⏭️ SKIPPED
**Reason:** Single-venue deployment (parents' business) - no public distribution needed
**Cost avoided:** $99/year (macOS) + $200-400/year (Windows)
**Workaround:** Manually add security exception on venue devices
~~[ ] macOS: Get Apple Developer certificate ($99/year)~~
~~[ ] macOS: Configure identity, hardenedRuntime, entitlements~~
~~[ ] macOS: Store certificate in GitHub Secrets (MACOS_CERTIFICATE)~~
~~[ ] Windows: Get code signing certificate (DigiCert/Sectigo)~~
~~[ ] Windows: Add signtool step to workflow~~
~~[ ] Windows: Store certificate in GitHub Secrets (WIN_CERT_PASSWORD)~~

**Phase 6: Distribution & Documentation**
[ ] Create installation guide (README or wiki)
[ ] Document first-time setup (API_BASE_URL, login)
[ ] Create download page or link to GitHub Releases
[ ] Add troubleshooting section (common errors)
[ ] Document update process (manual vs auto-update)

**Current Status:**
- Development builds working locally (`npm run dev`)
- Production packaging not configured (no electron-builder)
- No automated release pipeline
- Code signing: SKIPPED (single-venue deployment)
- Auto-update: SKIPPED (manual updates sufficient)

**Deployment Strategy (Single-Venue):**
- Tag releases: `git tag pos-v0.1.0 && git push --tags`
- GitHub Actions builds unsigned executables
- Download from GitHub Releases (private repo)
- Manual installation on venue devices
- Bypass OS security warnings on first launch:
  - **macOS**: System Settings → Privacy & Security → "Open Anyway"
  - **Windows**: "More info" → "Run anyway"
- Manual updates: Download and reinstall when needed

### 0.11 POS to Web Migration – ✅ PHASE 1 COMPLETE

**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Backend API Refinement In Progress  
**Timeline:** Phase 1: 2 days | Phase 1.5: TBD | Phase 2: 1-2 days  
**Architecture:** Integrated into existing frontend with role-based dashboard

#### Phase 1: Web Frontend Migration ✅ COMPLETED (Nov 22-23, 2025)

**Architecture Decision:**
[x] Integrated POS into existing frontend (simpler than separate app)
[x] Role-based dashboard: `/dashboard` shows POS for ADMIN, customer view for USER
[x] Reused existing auth system (session cookies)
[x] Single codebase, single deployment

**Frontend Implementation:**
[x] Created `frontend/services/pos-api.ts` with all POS API endpoints
[x] Migrated DashboardPage UI to `frontend/src/pages/pos/dashboard.tsx`
[x] Updated `frontend/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` for role-based rendering
[x] Fixed logout crash (proper React hooks structure)
[x] Removed redundant `/pos/*` routes (consolidated under `/dashboard`)
[x] Updated login flow to always redirect to `/dashboard`

**UI Components Migrated:**
[x] Real-time room status display (live clock, updates every second)
[x] Room status cards (Empty/Occupied with color indicators)
[x] Three management tabs: Bookings, Rooms, Tax Settings
[x] Today's bookings list with Complete/Cancel actions
[x] Room management with status dropdown (Active/Maintenance/Closed)
[x] Tax rate configuration (editable, persisted)
[x] Dark theme UI matching Electron app style

**API Integration (Frontend Ready):**
[x] Booking operations (list, create, update status, cancel)
[x] Room operations (list, update status)
[x] Menu operations (list, create, update, delete)
[x] Tax settings (get, update global tax rate)
[x] Error handling and loading states
[x] Session-based authentication (reused existing system)

**Completed Without Changes:**
[x] Authentication via session cookies (already exists)
[x] Responsive design (Tailwind CSS, works on all devices)
[x] No local database needed (direct API calls only)
[x] No Electron-specific code (pure React web app)

#### Phase 1.5: Backend API Refinement ✅ COMPLETE

[x] `POST /api/bookings` - create booking (user)
[x] `POST /api/bookings/admin/create` - admin create booking
[x] `PATCH /api/bookings/rooms/:id` - update room status
[x] `PATCH /api/bookings/:id/payment-status` - update payment status (admin)

**Backend Endpoints - Implemented in Phase 1.5:**
[x] `GET /api/bookings/:id` - get single booking details
[x] `PATCH /api/bookings/:id/status` - update booking status (Complete/Cancel)
[x] `GET /api/settings/global_tax_rate` - get tax rate (convenience endpoint)

### 1.1 POS API Key Security Improvement – ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Status:** Must be addressed before production deployment

**Current Issue:**
- POS authentication uses hardcoded static API key: `'pos-dev-key-change-in-production'`
- API key is visible in frontend code (anyone with app access can extract it)
- Same API key for all POS devices (no device-specific authentication)
- API key never expires (no rotation mechanism)

**Required Changes:**

[ ] **Backend:**
  - [ ] Add `POS_ADMIN_KEY` to backend/.env.example with security warning
  - [ ] Change default value in requireAuth.ts from hardcoded string to env-only
  - [ ] Set unique, strong `POS_ADMIN_KEY` in production .env
  - [ ] Document API key security in backend README
  - [ ] Restart backend server after env change

[ ] **Production Deployment:**
  - [ ] Generate cryptographically secure API key (e.g., `openssl rand -hex 32`)
  - [ ] Update production backend .env with new key
  - [ ] Test POS connectivity with new key
  - [ ] Document key rotation procedure

[ ] **Future Enhancements (Phase 2):**
  - [ ] Per-device API keys (track individual POS devices)
  - [ ] Key expiration and rotation mechanism
  - [ ] OAuth2 device flow for proper authentication
  - [ ] Store device keys in secure location (not in frontend code)
  - [ ] Audit log for API key usage

**Security Context:**
- Current method: Header `x-pos-admin-key` bypasses session authentication
- Risk: Anyone with app access can extract key and impersonate admin
- Web app uses HttpOnly session cookies (secure)
- POS uses static API key (insecure for production)

**Documentation:**
- Authentication architecture: `/docs/admin_manual_booking_feature.md`
- CSP configuration: `pos/apps/electron/src/renderer/index.html`
- Middleware: `backend/src/middleware/requireAuth.ts`

- E.164 format: +1XXXXXXXXXX (12 chars) for complete validation
- Partial E.164: Returns +1XXX for incomplete numbers (prevents deletion bug)

### 1.8 Frontend Build & Environment Configuration – ✅ Completed

**Production API URL Fix:**
[x] Fixed frontend API calls to use relative URLs instead of localhost
[x] Updated Dockerfile to set `REACT_APP_API_BASE=` (empty string)

[x] Deployed fix (commit d81e5c3: "fix: properly handle empty string for REACT_APP_API_BASE")
[x] Verified login works in production at k-golf.inviteyou.ca

**Implementation:**
- Environment Strategy: Empty string for production → relative URLs (`/api/auth/login`)
- Fallback for Development: `http://localhost:8080` when env var not set
- Webpack Logic: `process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE !== undefined ? process.env.REACT_APP_API_BASE : 'http://localhost:8080'`
- Result: No CORS issues, same-origin requests in production

**Architecture:**
- Unified deployment: Single Node.js container serving both frontend static files and API
- Path structure: `backend/dist/src/server.js` serves `backend/dist/public/` (frontend build output)
- Nginx: Reverse proxy on port 8082 to k-golf.inviteyou.ca

## 🔄 Phase 1.2 - Booking Status Simplification

> **Goal:** Simplify booking lifecycle and add split payment tracking
> **Documentation:** `/docs/BOOKING_STATUS_FLOW.md`
> **Status:** READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
> **Start Date:** 2025-11-29

### Overview

Refactor booking status model from complex 4-field approach to simplified 2-field system:
- **bookingStatus:** `BOOKED` | `COMPLETED` | `CANCELLED` | `EXPIRED` (lifecycle)
- **paymentStatus:** `UNPAID` | `PAID` (revenue tracking)
- **BookingPayment:** New table for per-seat payment tracking (split payments)

### Changes from v1.0
- ✅ `CONFIRMED` → `BOOKED` (more intuitive naming)
- ✅ Removed `BILLED` status (simplified to UNPAID/PAID)
- ✅ Added `EXPIRED` status (30-day cleanup)
- ✅ Added `completedAt` timestamp
- ✅ New `BookingPayment` model for split payments
- ✅ Removed `billedAt` column (no longer needed)

### Task 1.2.1: Database Schema & Migration

[ ] **Schema Updates:**
  - [x] Update Prisma schema: BookingPayment model added
  - [x] Update Booking model: BOOKED default, remove BILLED, add completedAt
  - [x] Create migration file (20250129_001_simplify_booking_status)
  
[ ] **Apply Migration:**
  - [ ] Run `npm run prisma:migrate` in backend/
  - [ ] Verify migration succeeds and all CONFIRMED→BOOKED conversions work
  - [ ] Test database state (no BILLED records remain)
  - [ ] Verify BookingPayment table created with indices

[ ] **Seed Script Updates:**
  - [ ] Update backend/prisma/seed.ts to use new status values
  - [ ] Create sample BookingPayment records for test data
  - [ ] Verify seed completes without errors
  - [ ] Check test data in DB (status values, payment records)

### Task 1.2.2: Backend Repository Layer

[ ] **bookingRepo.ts Updates:**
  - [ ] Add `createPayment(bookingId, customerName, seatIndex, amount, paymentMethod)` function
  - [ ] Add `getPaymentTotal(bookingId)` → sum of all BookingPayment amounts
  - [ ] Add `getPaymentsByBooking(bookingId)` → return all payment records
  - [ ] Update `completeBooking(id)` → validate PAID status required
  - [ ] Add `updateBookingStatus(id, newStatus)` → admin override (validate new status)
  - [ ] Update validators to allow: BOOKED | COMPLETED | CANCELLED | EXPIRED
  - [ ] Update tests for all new functions

[ ] **Validation & Business Logic:**
  - [ ] Prevent COMPLETED if paymentStatus ≠ PAID
  - [ ] Prevent changing COMPLETED bookings (except admin override)
  - [ ] Validate seatIndex range (1-4)
  - [ ] Validate payment amount > 0
  - [ ] Check total payments don't exceed booking price

### Task 1.2.3: Backend API Routes

[ ] **New Endpoints:**
  - [ ] `PATCH /api/bookings/:id/payment` → record payment (staff)
    - Body: `{ amount, paymentMethod, customerName, seatIndex }`
    - Response: booking + remaining balance
    - Validation: amount > 0, total ≤ price, booking is BOOKED
  
  - [ ] `PATCH /api/bookings/:id/complete` → mark COMPLETED (staff)
    - Body: `{}`
    - Response: booking with completedAt timestamp
    - Validation: paymentStatus must be PAID
  
  - [ ] `PATCH /api/bookings/:id/status` → admin override (admin only)
    - Body: `{ bookingStatus?, paymentStatus? }`
    - Response: updated booking
    - Validation: None (admin can do anything)

[ ] **Existing Endpoint Updates:**
  - [ ] `GET /api/bookings/:id` → include payments array
  - [ ] `GET /api/bookings` → include payment summary
  - [ ] `PATCH /api/bookings/:id/cancel` → prevent if COMPLETED
  - [ ] Update response schema to new status values

[ ] **Error Handling:**
  - [ ] 409 Conflict: Cannot complete without payment
  - [ ] 409 Conflict: Booking already completed
  - [ ] 400 Bad Request: Invalid payment amount
  - [ ] 404 Not Found: Booking not found

### Task 1.2.4: Frontend Components

[ ] **POS Dashboard Payment UI:**
  - [ ] Add "Collect Payment" button (visible if UNPAID)

    - [ ] Submit button
    - [ ] Cancel button
  
  - [ ] Display current payment status:
    - [ ] Show each payment record (customer name, amount, method)
    - [ ] Show remaining balance
    - [ ] Show total collected vs. total price

[ ] **Booking Completion UI:**
  - [ ] Add "Complete Booking" button (visible if PAID)
  - [ ] Confirmation dialog before completion
  - [ ] Display completion timestamp after success

[ ] **Admin Override UI:**

<details>
<summary>Coupon Scheduler Case Mismatch Fix - 2026-02-28</summary>

**Fixed birthday/loyalty coupon scheduler not finding coupon types:**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Backend Logging System with Pino - 2026-02-25</summary>

**Structured Logging Implementation:**
[x] Created shared pino logger module (`backend/src/lib/logger.ts`) — JSON in prod, pino-pretty in dev
[x] Installed `pino-http` for automatic request/response logging with `reqId` correlation
[x] Added request logging middleware to `server.ts` — logs method/url/statusCode/responseTime for all requests
[x] Replaced all 98 `console.log/error/warn` calls across 12 backend route files + middleware + services + jobs
[x] All route errors now use `req.log.error({ err, ...context }, 'message')` for structured backtracing
[x] Added global Express error handler (catch-all middleware for unhandled route errors)
[x] Added process crash handlers (`unhandledRejection`, `uncaughtException`) with fatal-level logging
[x] Removed stale `@types/pino` v7 dependency (pino v9 ships its own types)

**Docker Log Rotation:**
[x] Added `logging: { driver: json-file, options: { max-size: "15m", max-file: "10" } }` to `docker-compose.release.yml`
[x] Applied to both `backend` and `db` services (~150MB cap each)
[x] CI/CD auto-picks up config changes via `docker compose up -d`

**Frontend Error Handling:**
[x] Created `ErrorBoundary` React component wrapping top-level `<App />`
[x] Catches unhandled render crashes with fallback UI and "Go to Home" button
[x] Shows error stack in dev, clean message in prod
[x] Added `console.log` stripping in production builds via Terser `pure_funcs` config
[x] `console.error` and `console.warn` preserved in prod for debugging

**Files changed:**
- `docker-compose.release.yml` — log rotation config
- `backend/src/lib/logger.ts` — new shared pino logger
- `backend/src/server.ts` — pino-http middleware, global error handler, crash handlers
- `backend/src/routes/*.ts` (12 files) — all `console.*` → `req.log.*`
- `backend/src/middleware/requireAuth.ts` — `console.error` → `logger.error`
- `backend/src/services/emailService.ts` — `console.*` → `log.*` (child logger)
- `backend/src/jobs/couponScheduler.ts` — `console.*` → `log.*` (child logger)
- `backend/package.json` — added pino-http, removed @types/pino
- `frontend/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` — new React error boundary
- `frontend/src/main.tsx` — wrapped App with ErrorBoundary
- `frontend/webpack.config.js` — Terser config to strip console.log in prod

[x] Backend production build copies `backend/public` → `backend/dist/public`
[x] Simplified webpack config: always outputs to `dist` (no conditional paths)
[x] Simplified server.ts: always uses `../public` relative to `__dirname`
[x] Added `backend/public` to .gitignore (build artifact)
[x] Commit eadde42: "refactor: simplify frontend build output path"

**Architecture Consolidation:**
[x] Unified deployment: Single Node.js container serving both frontend and API
[x] TypeScript structure: `rootDir: "."` compiles to `dist/src/server.js`
[x] Path resolution works in all environments:
  - Dev: `src/../public` = `backend/public`
  - Prod: `dist/src/../public` = `backend/dist/public`
  - Docker: `/app/dist/src/../public` = `/app/dist/public`
[x] Docker multi-stage build: frontend → backend → runner
[x] Environment strategy: Empty string for production (relative URLs), localhost fallback for dev

**Deployment Pipeline:**
[x] GitHub Actions: Build image → Push to GHCR → SSH to server → Pull & restart
[x] Server: DigitalOcean droplet 147.182.215.135, Nginx reverse proxy on port 8082
